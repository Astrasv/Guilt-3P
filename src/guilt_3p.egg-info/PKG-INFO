# Guilt-3P (Formerly Roast-Proto)

Guilt-3P is a productivity tool that actively roasts you when you get distracted. It monitors your active windows and browser URLs (via extension) and uses TTS to shame you back to work.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Setup

1.  **Initialize Config**: Create a customization file for your own roasts/forbidden sites.
    ```bash
    guilt-3p init-config
    ```
    This creates a `config.json` (location shown in output) where you can add:
    - `custom_roasts`: List of strings.
    - `custom_forbidden`: List of domain keywords (e.g., "twitter").
    - `custom_browsers`: List of browser process names.

2.  **Install Extension**: The browser extension is required to track URLs.
    ```bash
    guilt-3p setup-extension
    ```
    Follow the on-screen instructions to load the unpacked extension in Chrome/Edge/Brave.

## Usage

### Standard CLI Mode
Runs the tracker with console output.
```bash
guilt-3p run
```
Commands while running:
- `break 5`: Take a 5-minute break.
- `quit`: Exit.

### TUI Mode (New!)
Runs the tracker with a fancy Textual dashboard.
```bash
guilt-3p-tui
```
Shortcuts:
- `b`: Take a 5-minute break.
- `q`: Quit.

## Customization

You can edit `config.json` to personalize your experience.

Example `config.json`:
```json
{
  "general": {
    "extend_defaults": true
  },
  "custom_roasts": [
    "Why are you watching cat videos?",
    "Your code is crying."
  ],
  "custom_forbidden": [
    "reddit",
    "youtube"
  ]
}
```
